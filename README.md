## Spotify Dataset

This project utilizes a **Spotify dataset** to power the music search and recommendations functionality. The dataset includes:
- **Track Information**: Names, IDs, durations, popularity scores, and explicit content flags.
- **Artist Information**: Names of the artists associated with each track.
- **Release Information**: Release dates and other metadata for the tracks.

### Source
The dataset is derived from Spotifyâ€™s public APIs and preprocessed for this project. It includes thousands of tracks and their metadata, enabling robust search and recommendation capabilities.

### Usage in the Project
1. **MongoDB Storage**: The Spotify dataset is imported into the MongoDB database.
2. **Search**: Tracks and artists are queried using regular expressions for partial matches.
3. **Recommendations**: Popularity scores and metadata are used to provide tailored recommendations.
